We model a percolation system using an n-by-n grid of sites. Each site is either open or blocked. A full site is an open site that can be connected to an open site in the top row via a chain of neighboring (left, right, up, down) open sites. We say the system percolates if there is a full site in the bottom row. In other words, a system percolates if we fill all open sites connected to the top row and that process fills some open site on the bottom row. (For the insulating/metallic materials example, the open sites correspond to metallic materials, so that a system that percolates has a metallic path from top to bottom, with full sites conducting. For the porous substance example, the open sites correspond to empty space through which water might flow, so that a system that percolates lets water fill open sites, flowing from top to bottom.)
Researchers are interested in the following question: if sites are independently set to be open with probability p (and therefore blocked with probability 1 âˆ’ p), what is the probability that the system percolates? When p equals 0, the system does not percolate; when p equals 1, the system percolates.
I made a percolation data type 

Percolation.java
    creates n-by-n grid, with all sites initially blocked
    public Percolation(int n)
    
    // opens the site (row, col) if it is not open already
    public void open(int row, int col)

    // is the site (row, col) open?
    public boolean isOpen(int row, int col)

    // is the site (row, col) full?
    public boolean isFull(int row, int col)

    // returns the number of open sites
    public int numberOfOpenSites()

    // does the system percolate?
    public boolean percolates()
    
 PercolationStats.java
 
   // perform independent trials on an n-by-n grid
    public PercolationStats(int n, int trials)

    // sample mean of percolation threshold
    public double mean()

    // sample standard deviation of percolation threshold
    public double stddev()

    // low endpoint of 95% confidence interval
    public double confidenceLo()

    // high endpoint of 95% confidence interval
    public double confidenceHi()
    
  PercolationStats performs a monteCarlo Simulaton to estimate P*, when running PercolationStats.java provide n and t as an argument for
  the main method. n is the size of the grid and t is the number of trials.
  
  
 algs4.jar includes an implementation to WeightedQuickFind
